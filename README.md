# ProgressBarFun

This app was created to demonstrate the simple creation of a progress bar.
I used an awesome app called PaintCode which essentially writes code based on what you design in the application.
We then import that code to xCode to link it up to a slider bar to show progress of a bar. This could easily be used for other things such as loading data.
